//TODO: To Reduce Api calls what we did is , before loading launch data and populating everytime server starts , we check if the launch already exists in DB by checking if the first rocket in present , IF the firt rocket is present meaning the launches have loaded and hence you dont need to call it everytime . REDUCES LOAD.

//TODO: If that first launch is absent, we load all the Data to the DB once and then don't need to do it again since the next time this LoadLaunch() function triggers, we'd already have 1st rocket and mission so there is no need to load the API again
